# Natural Language Processing - university assignment
This system takes the emails about the future seminars, speeaches, talks which will held at university and tags these emails using specified tags (\<paragraph\>, \<sentence\>, \<stime\>, \<etime\>, \<location\>, \<speaker\>). This system is also able to classify all these emails with the hardcoded onthology.

To run this system you should have NLTK installed.

Thank you!
