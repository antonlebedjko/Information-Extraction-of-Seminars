# Natural Language Processing - Information Extraction of Seminars
 This system takes the emails about the future seminars, speeches, talks, which will be held at university and tags these emails using specified tags (\<paragraph\>, \<sentence\>, \<stime\>, \<etime\>, \<location\>, \<speaker\>). This system is also able to classify all these emails with the hardcoded onthology.

 To run this system you should have NLTK installed
 Thank you!
