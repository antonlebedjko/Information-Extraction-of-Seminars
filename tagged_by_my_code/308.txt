<paragraph>	  INTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE SOURCES IN LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION</paragraph>

<paragraph>			 <sentence>Tuesday, 12 February 1991

    Multiple types   of  knowledge (syntax,  semantics,   pragmatics, etc</sentence>.)
contribute to establishing the meaning of  an  utterance.  <sentence>Delaying the use
of   a knowledge   source    during   language   comprehension   introduces
computational inefficiency in the  form  of overgeneration</sentence>.   <sentence>On the  other
hand, ensuring that all relevant knowledge is brought  to bear as each word
in the sentence is understood is a difficult design problem</sentence>.  <sentence>As a solution
to this problem, we present  NL-Soar, a language comprehension system  that
integrates  disparate knowledge sources automatically</sentence>.  <sentence>Through experience,
the nature of the understanding process changes from deliberate, sequential
problem   solving to  recognitional  comprehension   that  applies all  the
relevant knowledge sources    simultaneously to  each word</sentence>.     <sentence>The dynamic
character of the system results directly from its implementation within the
Soar architecture</sentence>.</paragraph>
