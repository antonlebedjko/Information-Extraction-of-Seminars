<paragraph><sentence>The Connection Machine Model CM-5 Supercomputer is a massively
parallel computer system designed to offer performance in the range of
1 teraflops ($10^{12}$ floating-point operations per second)</sentence>.  <sentence>The
CM-5 obtains its high performance while offering ease of programming,
flexibility, and reliability</sentence>.  <sentence>The machine contains three
communication networks: a data network, a control network, and a
diagnostic network</sentence>.  <sentence>This talk will describe the organization of these
three networks and how they contribute to the design goals of the
CM-5</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This work was done jointly with Zahi S</sentence>. <sentence>Abuhamdeh, David C</sentence>.  <sentence>Douglas,
Carl R</sentence>. <sentence>Feynman, Mahesh N</sentence>. <sentence>Ganmukhi, Jeffrey V</sentence>. <sentence>Hill, W</sentence>. <sentence>Daniel
Hillis, Bradley C</sentence>. <sentence>Kuszmaul, Margaret A</sentence>. St.~<sentence>Pierre, David S</sentence>. <sentence>Wells,
Monica C</sentence>. <sentence>Wong, Shaw-Wen Yang, Robert Zak, and about 500 others</sentence>.</paragraph>
