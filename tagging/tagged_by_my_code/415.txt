<paragraph><sentence>The S3</sentence>.mp scalable multiprocessor system is an experimental research project
that is being implemented by <sentence>SMCC's Technology Development group (TD) to
demonstrate a low overhead, high throughput communication system that is based
on cache coherent distributed shared memory (DSM)</sentence>.  <sentence>Conceptually, S3</sentence>.mp is a
virtual bus-extender that preserves the semantics of accessing memory across
all nodes.  <sentence>Unlike multiprocessor busses that use broadcasting to maintain
memory coherency, S3</sentence>.mp uses directories and point-to-point messages that are
send over a packet switched interconnect fabric to achieve scalability over a
wide range of system configurations.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Communication technology advances, such as high speed fiber optics, are the
driving force behind the S3</sentence>.mp development.  <sentence>While it is technically easier to
utilize the increased bandwidth with conventional memory-to-memory copy
engines, the resulting message passing hardware requires substantial software
overhead to process protocol stacks, manage buffers, encode and decode
messages, etc</sentence>.  <sentence>In S3</sentence>.mp, communication happens as a side-effect of accessing
 memory:  a single store or load instruction is sufficient to send or receive
 data.  <sentence>The set of transactions that are required to support the DSM paradigm
 is small and well defined so that the S3</sentence>.mp protocols were amenable to formal
 verification methods and are implemented directly in hardware.</paragraph>

<paragraph>S3.mp systems are similar to <sentence>ALEWILE, DASH, PLUS and other nonuniform memory
access (NUMA) multiprocessors</sentence>.  <sentence>However unlike these conventional NUMA MPs,
which strive to deliver the most MFlops to one scientific application, S3</sentence>.mp
is optimized for a large collection of independent applications that share
common computing resources which may be spatially distributed.  <sentence>Consequently,
S3</sentence>.mp nodes may be separated by up to 200m, which means that a S3.mp system
could be distributed over an entire building.  <sentence>Essentially, S3</sentence>.mp systems are
build by adding a specialized interconnect controller to the memory subsystem
of a normal workstation.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>The talk will describe the S3</sentence>.mp architecture and the technologies used to
implement it.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Joint work with M</sentence>. <sentence>Parkin, E</sentence>. <sentence>Kelly, M</sentence>. <sentence>Browne, G</sentence>. <sentence>Aybay, and H</sentence>. <sentence>Lee of

Alto Research Center (PARC)</sentence>.</paragraph>
