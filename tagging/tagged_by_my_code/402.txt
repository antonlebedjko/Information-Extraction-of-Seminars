<paragraph><sentence>Vectorization techniques have proved to be extremely effective
for large-scale reservoir simulations</sentence>.  <sentence>Parallel capabilities
hold even greater potential for these enormous problems</sentence>.  <sentence>Domain
decomposition methods can allow the physical problem to be divided
up into many similar problems that can be addressed separately,
in parallel, on different processors</sentence>.  <sentence>These techniques also allow
efficient application of local grid refinement to resolve the
important local phenomena that may govern the flow process</sentence>.
<sentence>Eulerian-Lagrangian methods that follow the flow also can profit
extensively from parallel treatment of the characteristics of the
flow</sentence>.  <sentence>The effectiveness of these techniques will be demonstrated
on research codes and illustrative applications</sentence>.</paragraph>
