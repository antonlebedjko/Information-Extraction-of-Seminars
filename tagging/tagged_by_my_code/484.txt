              Household Demand for Garbage and Recycling Collection
                    with the Start of a Price per Bag

                        **All are invited to attend**

<paragraph><sentence>This paper estimates household reaction to the implemenation of a
volume-based pricing program for the collecion of residential garbage</sentence>. 
<sentence>We gather original data on weight and volume of weekly garbage and
recycling of 75 households in Charlottesville, Virgina, both before and
after the implementation of a program which requires an eighty-cent
sticker on each bag of garbage</sentence>.  <sentence>This data set is the first of its kind</sentence>.
 <sentence>We estimate household demands for the collection of garbage and
recyclable material, the effect on the density of household garbage,
and the amount of illegal dumping conducted by housholds</sentence>.  <sentence>We also employ
a basic probit model to estimate the probability that a househod chooses
each of several methods available to reduce their garbage</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In response to the implementation of this volume-based pricing program,
we find that households (1) reduced the weight of their garbage by
14</sentence>.0%, (2) reduced the volume of garbage by 37.0% and (3) increased the
weight of their recyclable materials by 15.7%.  <sentence>We estimate that
additional illegal -- or at least suspicious -- disposal accounts for
0</sentence>.486 pounds per week per person in <sentence>Charlottesville, or 32% of the total
reduction in garbage observed at the curb</sentence>.</paragraph>
