Abstract: 


   KSR1: High Performance and Ease of Programming,
          No Longer an Oxymoron

<paragraph>		 Steve Frank

<paragraph><sentence>Historically, shared memory has been the main line programming model from
an applications and computer science perspective for two reasons: shared
memory is a flexible and high performance means of communicating between
processors, tasks or threads and; shared memory provides high programming
efficiency through use of conventional memory management methods</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>The KSRl bridges the gap between the historical shared memory model and
MPPs by delivering the shared memory programming model and all of its
benefits, in a scalable, highly parallel architecture</sentence>.  <sentence>The KSRl runs
a broad range of mainstream applications, ranging from numerically
intensive computation, to on-line transaction processing (OLTP) and
database management and inquiry</sentence>.  <sentence>The KSRl's shared memory programming
model is made possible by a new architectural technique called ALLCACHE</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This talk will start by describing ALLCACHE, a logical extension of virtual
memory and cache memory</sentence>.  <sentence>The shared memory programming model delivered by
ALLCACHE facilitates porting and high performance for customer and third
party applications</sentence>.  <sentence>Within this context, the KSRl architecture and
applications environment consisting of a conventional UNIX based OS
(symmetrically executing across all processors) and programming environment
(including conventional languages) will be described</sentence>.  <sentence>The talk will conclude
with a discussion of experiences porting customer specific and third party
applications</sentence>.</paragraph>
